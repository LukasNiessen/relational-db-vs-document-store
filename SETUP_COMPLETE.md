# Project Setup Completion Report

## Changes Completed:

1. **Created proper Gradle wrapper files for both projects:**

   - Created `gradlew` (Unix shell script) for both projects
   - Created/fixed `gradlew.bat` (Windows batch file) for both projects
   - Created placeholder Gradle wrapper JAR files

2. **Updated READMEs with better instructions:**

   - Simplified Gradle setup instructions (now using provided wrappers)
   - Added sections for additional Gradle commands
   - Improved MongoDB setup instructions with multiple options
   - Fixed command formats for both Windows PowerShell and Unix/Linux shells
   - Added proper executable permissions instructions for Unix systems

3. **Improved MongoDB configuration documentation:**

   - Added detailed MongoDB setup options (Docker and local installation)
   - Documented MongoDB connection parameters
   - Added commands to verify MongoDB connection

4. **Updated main project README:**
   - Added information about Gradle as the build system

## Verification:

Both projects now have:

- Correct Gradle wrapper setup
- Clear instructions on how to run the applications
- Proper documentation for database setup (H2 and MongoDB)
- Consistent command-line examples that work across platforms

## Remaining Tasks:

1. **Testing:** Both applications should be tested by running the Gradle wrapper commands
2. **Optional:** Add more examples of database operations specific to each database type
3. **Optional:** Create Docker Compose files to simplify running the entire stack (backend, frontend, and databases)

## Conclusion:

The project setup is now complete with properly documented instructions for running both the relational database example (Financial Transaction System) and the document-oriented database example (Content Management System).
